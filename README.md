# Physics-simulator
We will simulate basic physics using python with library pygame to show the graphic, pymunk to calculate the physics, and matplotlib to show the graph after the simulation.

# Acceralation
We will simulate a square moving with acceleration, and see the graph. (There is only the acceleration in the x-axis)

This is a velocity graph as you can see acceleration make the velocity larger in a linear way because the acceleration is constant.

However the position is not linear that is because the longer it takes the faster it gets, basically you can move faster as the time goes by. That is why the position is curve but not linear.
